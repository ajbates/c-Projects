==========

The maximum deflection at the end of a cantilevered beam is given by the formula shown in
equation 1. Using the formula, write a program that prompts the user for a Length, Height, and
Base in feet, and the objects Weight in pounds, as double-precision arguments. Then calculate
the deflection in inches for Aluminum, Wood, and Steel based upon the same length, height, and
base received from the user and the elasticity given below. Display all the values on the screen in
the form of a table with column headers and aligned column values. 

dmax = 4Wl^3/Ebh^3

• Aluminum = 1.49e9
• Wood = .187e9
• Steel = 3.9e9
